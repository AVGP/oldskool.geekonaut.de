#What's this?

A telnet-able interface to Geekonaut.de.
You can see a live demo by typing the following into your terminal:

```bash
telnet geekonaut.de 2342
```

Have fun!

#Telnet-ize your website, too!
So you want to earn some geekness for your website, too?

You can easily do so:

1. Install node.js and something that can run your node.js app continuously (e.g. [forever](http://npmjs.org/forever))
2. Run server.js (e.g. with ``forever start server.js``)
3. Put your website content as text or markdown into the content/ subfolder.
4. That should be it :)

alternatively, you can host this on Heroku et. al.
